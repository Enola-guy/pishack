## Package Control

The recommended way to install RegReplace is via [Package Control][package-control].  Package Control will install the correct branch on your system and keep it up to date.

1. Ensure Package Control is installed.  Instructions are found [here][package-control-install].

2. In Sublime Text, press ++ctrl+shift+p++ (Win, Linux) or ++cmd+shift+p++ (OSX) to bring up the quick panel and start typing `Package Control: Install Package`.  Select the command and it will show a list of installable plugins.

3. Start typing `replacer`; when you see it, select it.

4. Restart to be sure everything is loaded properly.

5. Enjoy!

Add in keybinding :
```
[
	{ "keys": ["ctrl+d"], "command": "replacer" }
]
```
